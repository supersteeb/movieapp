## Notes

- **State:** Make it simple to track what the UI is doing
- **Components:** Composition of lots of different simple pieces makes things easier.
- **JSX:** Pokemon name={pokemon.name}
states = {states}>

- **Props and State:** Props are constant and can be anythning (including functions). State can change. Generally just a POJO (plain old javascript object)
